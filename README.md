## Project Overview
This project is an online bookstore built with Spring Boot.  
It allows administrators to manage categories and books, and users to browse, add books to their cart, place orders, and manage their profile.  
The application uses JWT authentication for security, supports pagination and sorting, and provides an interactive API documentation via Swagger.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Security**
- **Hibernate**
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**
- **JUnit 5 & Mockito**
- **Maven**
- **MySQL**

## Models and Relations
- Book (Many-to-Many with Category)
- CartItem(Many-to-One with ShoppingCart, Many-to-One with Book)
- Category (Many-to-Many with Book)
- Order (One-to-Many with OrderItem, Many-to-One with User)
- OrderItem (Many-to-One with Order)
- ShoppingCart (One-to-Many with CartItem, One-to-one with User)
- User (Many-to-Many with Role, One-to-Many with Order, One-to-One with ShoppingCart)

## Features I used in my project
- **Category Management** – CRUD operations for categories with soft delete support.
- **Book Management** – CRUD operations for books, with category assignments.
- **User Roles** – Basic authentication and role-based access (`USER`, `ADMIN`).
- **Bearer Token Authentication** – All protected endpoints require a valid JWT token.
- **Pagination & Sorting** – For listing large datasets efficiently.
- **API Documentation** – Interactive Swagger UI.
- **Database Migrations** – Managed with Liquibase.
- **Integration & Unit Tests** – Ensuring stability and correctness.

## Getting Started (Local Run)
1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2) Configure the database
   Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your database credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bookstore
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword

3) Build your project

mvn clean package

4) Build and run the application

mvn spring-boot:run

5) Access the API

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
Secured endpoints require a valid Bearer Token in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

## Changes
1) Database migration conflicts – Initially, some Mysql changesets caused inconsistencies between environments. 
This was solved by splitting migrations into smaller, atomic files and enforcing version control for changelogs.
And also I had problems with foreign and primary keys.

2) JWT authentication issues – Early token validation bugs were fixed by implementing a custom JWT filter and adding comprehensive integration tests.

3) Pagination and filtering – Complex queries for retrieving books by multiple categories were optimized using Spring Data JPA’s Specification API.

4) Testing - I had problems with dropping and creating tables in database, but I solved this with excluding keys and truncating all tables.

## Postman Collections
In each request you need to use Authentication through Bearer token, so before each request login into system 
and remember that this token is valid for 5 minutes then you will need to re-login in order to get new token 
and remember that if you send request to add, delete, update your user need to have role Admin
